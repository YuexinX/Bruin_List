## Reason for discontinueing
To shorten the developing time we have decided to switch to use Firebase for our backend development.

## Original Desired Features
### Dynamic Data
When a user makes a post on a forum, the webpage will change in response to the new content. Every user on the platform will then be able to view this post and its content. In addition, when users like and comment on posts, the associated numerical values on the webpage will change in response.

### Back-end
After the user posts content, the content of the post will be uploaded to our database which will be stored securely on the cloud. 

### Searching
Users can utilize our search bar to search through the posts on the website and narrow it down to what the user may wish to see. This data will be retrieved and queried from our database. Searching properties may include keywords and associated tags within the post content. 

### User Authentication
To use the platform, users must create an account, verify their email, and log in to the platform. Each post is publicly associated with a user.

### Liking and Commenting on Posts
Users can like and comment on posts based on their reactions to the content.

### User Profiles
Users can visit a list of all user profiles and query through them. Users can also elect to "upvote" profiles as many times as they wish.
